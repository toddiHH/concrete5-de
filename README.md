# concrete5 German localization

These files contain German localization files for the concrete5 Content Management System.

## Version

5.6.0

## Contents

- The .mo/.po files containing the German localization based on the translatable strings in the CMS source.
- An updated TinyMCE folder (version 3.5.6) with the custom Concrete plugins and full German localization strings

## Installation

Place the files into your web root folder (or where the concrete5 CMS is located).
The default concrete5 installation provides two empty folders in your web root:
- js
- languages
The files in this repository belong there.
Do not copy the files into the CMS's system folder "concrete".

The included TinyMce version overrides the one that ships with concrete5 in order to provide German localization here as well and allows for updating the editor independently from concrete5.
